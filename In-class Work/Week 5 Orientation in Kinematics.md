------------------
## 1. Rotation in CoppeliaSim

- [ ] Open a new scene in CoppeliaSim

- [ ] From the left-side "Model Browser", go to "Others" folder, select "Reference frame"

- [ ] Drag and place the "Reference frame" into the new scene

- [ ] Set the item at world origin and align with world frame (x-y-z frame in bottom right corner). To do so, we need to:

 * Go to "Object Shift", In "Position" → "Relative to World", set all X, Y, Z to be 0
 * Go to "Object Rotation", In "Orientation" → "Relative to World", set all Alpha, Beta, Gamma to be 0

- [ ] Once done, you should get the same looking as this picture
