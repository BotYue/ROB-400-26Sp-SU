## 1. Two-DOF planar manipulator

- [ ] Download the  provided ``Asset/week2_2DoF_planar.ttt`` scene file. 

- [ ] Open the file in CoppeliaSim. You will see a two-DOF planar manipulator.

- [ ] In the Scene hierarchy (left panel), observe the joint–link structure of the robot.

- [ ] The world frame is displayed in the corner of the scene view: the X-axis points to the right, the Y-axis points upward, the 
Z-axis is perpendicular to the 2D plane.

- [ ] Try to use "Joint tool" to rorate the two joints. To do so: <br>click one joint in Scene hierarchy, then go to "Modules -> Kinematics -> Joint tool", it will pop out a small window showing angle adjustment. <br>Feel free to play with any angles for the given two joints.

- [ ] After rotating the joints, the final position of the end-effector can be viewed by:<br> click the "tip" in Scene hierarchy, then the `x: ..., y: ..., z:...` info will be displayed on top of the scene view.
