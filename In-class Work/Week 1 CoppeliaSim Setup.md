## 2. Coding Basics
- [ ] You can expand the list in the "Scene Hierarchy". You will see a file named “Script”. It is an "embedded script" in the scene. 
- [ ] In the "kinematics folder -> twoRobotsIK.ttt" example, the script is written in Lua.
- [ ] Read these pages in official manual to grab some understandings: https://manual.coppeliarobotics.com/
 ** The "Writing code" page
 ** The "Embedded scripts" page
 ** The "Lua vs Python scripts" page
